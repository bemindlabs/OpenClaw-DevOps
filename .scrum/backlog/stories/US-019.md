## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** Prometheus configured to scrape metrics from all services,
**So that** I can monitor system health and set up alerting.

## Description

Configure Prometheus to collect metrics from all platform services including application endpoints, database exporters, and infrastructure metrics. Set up alerting rules for critical conditions and configure appropriate retention policies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prometheus scrapes all configured targets
- [ ] Scrape interval configured at 15 seconds
- [ ] All exporters registered (Node, cAdvisor, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Application metrics endpoint scraped (/metrics)
- [ ] Alert rules for service down, high error rate, high latency
- [ ] Alert rules for disk space, memory, CPU
- [ ] 30-day retention configured
- [ ] Web UI accessible with basic auth
- [ ] Prometheus health endpoint returning healthy
- [ ] Service discovery for Docker containers (optional)
